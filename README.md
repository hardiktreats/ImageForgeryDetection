Image Forgery Detection using GANs
This project aims to develop an image forgery detection system using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs are a class of deep learning models that consist of a generator and a discriminator, trained in an adversarial manner. The generator learns to generate realistic images, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated images.

In this project, we train a GAN on a dataset of authentic images and use it to detect forged images. The GAN learns the underlying patterns and features present in genuine images, allowing it to identify inconsistencies and artifacts in forged images.

The forgery detection process involves passing an input image through the trained GAN and analyzing the discriminator's output. If the discriminator classifies the image as fake, it indicates the presence of forgery.

By leveraging the power of GANs, we aim to develop an accurate and robust system for image forgery detection, which can be used for various applications, including digital forensics and authentication.
